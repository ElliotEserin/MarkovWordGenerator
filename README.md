# MarkovWordGenerator
A random word generator using Markov chains and C#

You can create an instance of the Markov class and provide a training set of example words you would like to mimic.
From this you can then generate random words that follow the rules of the dataset.
This works off of a statistics model called a Markov Chain - where the probability of any next state depends only on the state before it.
